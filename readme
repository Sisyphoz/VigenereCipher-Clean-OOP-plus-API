'Vigenere Cipher API' is a simple RESTful API that uses encrypt() and decrypt() 
methods of the VigenereCipher class as endpoints. 

The API is built using the Flask framework and can be used to encrypt and decrypt 
plaintext using the Vigenere Cipher algorithm.

Getting Started

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

pip install flask

Start the API by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

python app.py

This will start the Flask development server and make the API available at http://localhost:5000/. 
You can test the API using a REST client like Postman, or by sending HTTP requests using a tool like curl.

API Endpoints

The Vigenere Cipher API has two endpoints:
/encrypt

This endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing a plaintext and a key, and returns a JSON payload.

Example request:

POST /encrypt HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "plaintext": "Fresh magdalenas are amazing. Maybe not?",
    "key": "SECRET"
}

Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "ciphertext": "XVGJLFSKFRPXFEURVXSQCQMGYQCPFXFSV"
}

/decrypt

This endpoint accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing a ciphertext and a key, and returns a JSON payload.

Example:

POST /decrypt HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5000
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "ciphertext": "XVGJLFSKFRPXFEURVXSQCQMGYQCPFXFSV",
    "key": "SECRET"
}

Example response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "plaintext": "FRESHMAGDALENASAREAMAZINGMAYBENOT"
}

Error Handling:

If the API encounters an error, it will return a JSON payload with an error message and an HTTP status code indicating the type of error.

Here are some common error scenarios:

    If the request payload is missing a plaintext or ciphertext field, the API will return a 400 Bad Request error with a message indicating the missing field.
    If the request payload is missing a key field, the API will return a 400 Bad Request error with a message indicating the missing field.
    If the plaintext or ciphertext field contains non-alphabetic characters, the API will return a 400 Bad Request error with a message indicating the invalid characters.
    If the key field is empty, the API will return a 400 Bad Request error with a message indicating that the key cannot be empty.
    If an unexpected error occurs, the API will return a 500 Internal Server Error with a message indicating the error.
